This dataset has been meticulously designed to simulate the data collected by a wearable interface aimed at detecting drowsy drivers. The dataset encompasses various physiological and environmental parameters that are indicative of a driver's state of alertness. The parameters include heart rate, respiration rate, accelerometer data, vehicle speed, traffic conditions, and weather conditions. This comprehensive dataset is pivotal for training machine learning models to accurately identify drowsiness in drivers, which is a significant factor in reducing road accidents and improving road safety.

Dataset Generation Process
The dataset was generated using a Python script that ensures the data values are representative of two distinct classes: non-drowsy drivers (class 0) and drowsy drivers (class 1). The process involved generating random values for each parameter, tailored to reflect realistic conditions for both classes. Here’s an overview of how each parameter was simulated:

Heart Rate:

Non-drowsy drivers: Heart rate values were randomly chosen between 60 and 80 beats per minute, reflecting a normal resting heart rate.
Drowsy drivers: Heart rate values ranged between 80 and 100 beats per minute, indicating an increased heart rate often associated with drowsiness.
Respiration Rate:

Non-drowsy drivers: Respiration rates were generated between 12 and 16 breaths per minute, representing normal breathing.
Drowsy drivers: Respiration rates varied between 16 and 20 breaths per minute, indicating faster breathing due to drowsiness.
Accelerometer Data:

Non-drowsy drivers: Accelerometer readings followed a normal distribution centered around 0 with a standard deviation of 1, simulating stable and controlled movements.
Drowsy drivers: Readings followed a normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 2, representing more erratic movements associated with drowsiness.
Vehicle Speed:

Non-drowsy drivers: Speeds were randomly selected between 0 and 60 km/h, indicating cautious driving.
Drowsy drivers: Speeds ranged between 60 and 120 km/h, reflecting less controlled driving at higher speeds.
Traffic Conditions:

Non-drowsy drivers: Traffic conditions were assigned values between 0 and 50, simulating lighter traffic.
Drowsy drivers: Values ranged between 50 and 100, indicating heavier traffic conditions that might contribute to stress and fatigue.
Weather Conditions:

Non-drowsy drivers: Weather conditions were assigned values between 0 and 50, indicating milder weather.
Drowsy drivers: Values ranged between 50 and 100, representing harsher weather conditions that could contribute to drowsiness.
